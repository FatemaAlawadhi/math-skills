## Objectives
The purpose of this project is for you to calculate the following:
Average
Median
Variance
Standard Deviation

## Instructions
The program must be able to read from a file and print the result of each statistic mentioned above. In other words, the program must be able to read the data present in the path passed as argument. The data in the file will be presented as the following example:

189 <br>
113 <br>
121 <br>
114 <br>
145 <br>
110 <br>
... <br>
This data represents a statistical population: each line contains one value.

The result will apear as:

Average: 35 <br>
Median: 4 <br>
Variance: 5 <br>
Standard Deviation: 65

Please note that the values are rounded integers.

## Usage 
To run the program follow the below steps:

1. Dowmload https://assets.01-edu.org/stats-projects/math-skills
2. Enter in the terminal:
```
chmod u+x math-skills (only the first time)
```
```
./math-skills 
```
```
go run main.go data.txt
```

3. compare between the values :)
